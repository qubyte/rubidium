Rubidium is a one-time task emitter, inspired by the unix `at` utility. This
module is a minimal implementation. It exports a constructor. Instances of the
constructor are event emitters, with methods to add and remove job
specifications. A job consists of a due time and a message.

Rubidium is built upon the use of `setTimeout`, so [the usual warnings apply](http://nodejs.org/api/timers.html#timers_settimeout_callback_delay_arg).
That said, Rubidium creates a fresh timeout after each job is emitted, so it is
self-correcting to within the resolution of a timer.

Rubidium is built on
[vetebrate-event-emitter](https://github.com/qubyte/vertebrate-event-emitter),
which makes it robust against memory leaks. It has been bundled for you with
its dependencies, so Rubidium has no dependencies in production.

Both UMD (for your CommonJS, AMD, and browser global needs) and ES2015 flavour
modules have been provided, so you can use this module easily with all major
module systems.

## Usage

A brief example is given below. See the examples directory for some more
interesting examples, including wrapping a rubidium instance in an HTTP server,
and persisting a rubidium instance over app restarts.

```javascript
var Rubidium = require('rubidium');

var rb = new Rubidium();

rb.on('job', job => console.log(job.message));

// Add a job to be emitted in 5 seconds time.
rb.add({ time: Date.now() + 5000, message: '5 seconds have passed.' });

// Add a job to be emitted in one day.
rb.add({ time: Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24, 'One day as passed.' });
```

You could of course do this with vanilla timeouts. A rubidium instance allows
you to do it all with a single timeout. It also works around the maximum timeout
length, so you can have a job more than about 25 days into the future.

## API

`Rubidium` extends
[`vertebrate-event-emitter`](https://github.com/qubyte/vertebrate-event-emitter),
so please see the docs for that for the base API around events (methods like
`on`, `off` etc.)

### `var rb = new Rubidium()`

Construct a new Rubidium instance.

### `var hasJobs = rb.hasPendingJobs`

A boolean property. True when there are jobs remaining in the queue.

### `var job = rb.add({ time, message, [uuid] }, silent)`

Add a job. The `time` must be a `Date` instance or a timestamp integer (like
`Date.now()`) representing the time for the job to be emitted. This method
returns a job with a uuid property that may be used to find or remove the job
from the queue.

When `uuid` is in the spec, it will be copied into the job. This is useful for
reviving a persisted queue (see the section on persistence below). In general,
you should not be setting this.

When `silent` is true, this `addJob` event will not be emitted. This is useful
for reviving a persisted queue.

### `var job = rb.remove(uuid, silent)`

Remove a job from a Rubidium instance with the job uuid. This function returns a
job if the job existed and was removed, or `undefined` if the job did not exist.
When `silent` is true, the `removeJob` event will not be emitted.

### `var job = rb.find(uuid)`

Get a job from the Rubidium instance with the job uuid. Returns `undefined` when
no matching job is found.

### `rb.clear(silent)`

Clear all pending jobs. When silent is true, the `clearJobs` event will not be
emitted.

### Event: `'job'`

Listeners on the `'job'` event receive a job object containing `time` and
`message` fields, where `time` is an integer.

### Event: `'addJob'`

This event is emitted when a new job is added. The job object is passed as an
argument to listeners on this event.

### Event: `'removeJob'`

This event is emitted when when a job is removed. The job object is passed as an
argument to listeners on this event. When the `clear` method is used, this event
is emitted for every job.

### Event: `'clearJobs'`

This event is emitted when all jobs for a Rubidium instance are cleared.
